Goal: Downloading tweets without stopping.

This work is based on tweepy (a open-source Twitter Crawler).

In our work, we extend tweepy to multi-thread safe version, and allow it to run permanently without stopping.
(The process will kill itself and restart every hour)

Note that even the Twitter service is unavailable, this version will keep trying without stopping.
